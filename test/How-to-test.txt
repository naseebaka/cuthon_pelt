To test the performance comparison between rupture and the modified module,

Update the parameters in petl_demo_test.py, keep the python module (Win-64) in same directory and run petl_demo_test.py

First the test code imports rupture and runs the pelt test, prints the timings and shows the graph

When we close the graph, the code uses the local python module and does the same operations and prints the timings


Uses same signal for both cases
Compares the output for equality in both cases
